# abigail-ross-portfolio

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a web page that would function as my portfolio. It would display an image of me, give the user information about me, provide links to projects I have completed, and give the user my contact information. It would also have a navbar for users to access each of these sections easily. As I progress in this course I will update it with more projects I have completed to showcase all of my work.

## Usage

Upon opening the page users can scroll to view the about me section containing my image and information. Then they can scroll to view the section showing my work and when they click upon an image it will take them to the pages link for that project. Then they can scroll to the contact me section where they can find my email and phone number. If they click upon my email it will take them to their mail application on their device. It will have my email already filled in and ready to send a message. If they do not feel like scrolling to each section they can also utilize the navbar and click on whichever section they would like to view. It will then take them to that section of the page.
